Commit Reminder is an [Atom](https://atom.io/) package that will remind you to `git commit` after 1,000 keystrokes.

### Installation

The easiest way to install a package on Atom is by navigating to Settings/Preferences > Install > Search for `commit-reminder`.

If you prefer the hard way, there's also `apm install atom-beautify`.

Enjoy!
